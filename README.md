# Predictive Modelling of Loan Approval – Lasiandra Finance Inc.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Data Analytical Programming (CT050-3-M-DAP)** module at **Asia Pacific University (APU)**.  
It focuses on building a **predictive loan approval model** for **Lasiandra Finance Inc. (LFI)**, a private financial company in New York, USA.  

The goal is to automate the loan-eligibility process using **data science techniques** and **SAS programming**, reducing human error, improving efficiency, and enhancing decision-making accuracy.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer-related factors influencing loan approval:
  - Gender, marital status, family size, qualification, employment type
  - Candidate income, guarantor income, loan amount, loan history, loan location
- Preprocess and clean datasets to handle missing values.
- Build predictive models for loan approval using **SAS Studio**.
- Generate professional reports and visualizations for business decision-making.
- Demonstrate how **data analytics** can minimize risk and improve profitability in financial institutions.
